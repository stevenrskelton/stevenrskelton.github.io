Is this a chaotic scramble to get into the cloud. Do companies know what they are doing? Is it economical?

What is the public cloud, and how can it go wrong?

First, what is the basis for this pesimism?

In Q1 of 2022, the top three cloud infrastructure providers were AWS (33% market share), Microsoft Azure (21%) and
Google Cloud (8%).
Consider the 2 largest players, Amazon peak market cap 1.9T, and while online retail is large operating incomes
oscillate around break even. Compare to Walmart that had peak MK of 439B. Or Microsoft, was left for dead with OS and
Office, revived with XBox . Compare to Sony, who splits the gaming segment 50/50 with a 100B market cap.

Where is this cloud profit coming from? Yes investors are buying growth so it is overpriced. But how are cloud providers
offering more economic value over private cloud, colocation, or on premis?

Geograpically speaking, there are pros and cons, better network connectivity than public clouds. An office NAS and email
server replaced by the cloud.

All things being equal, a lift-and-shift means a 1-1 replacement with cloud hardware that you would normally have
bought. For companies with a self-managed infrastructure there is no savings in a public cloud.

Commoifying hardware? Don't say the value is that they can buy in bulk; 2T companies based on profits essentially being
middleman hardware distributers.

It is a simple fact that on-demand hardware will burn money. Amazon Reserved Instances provide you with a significant
discount (up to 72%) for 1-3 year lock in. Trying to extricate back out of the cloud means a transition, across stagered
lock-in periods.

So why are companies moving? Success stories of digital business transformations.

Success in the cloud means changing how your business functions. Competing 1-1 the public cloud will be more expensive.

Maximize the benefits of the cloud. That means conditional capacity, varying in time.

- auto scale when necessary.
- month end capacity, don't pay for it during the rest of the month
- event driven capacity.

No server upkeep, patching, upgrading.
