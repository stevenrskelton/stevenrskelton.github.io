A 30 minute presentation I made on Sept 19th in a [Scala-Toronto Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Scala/Toronto-CA/). The slides introduce [Apache Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org/) and the additional features offered by the [Twitter Finagle](http://twitter.github.io/finagle/) stack.

The overall theme is presenting the lessons learnt while using of the cross-language RPC capabilities of Thrift to transition a Microsoft .Net C# workplace to Scala.

The presentation’s slides are from a technical prospective; a co-worker has an [excellent blog](http://randonom.com/blog/2013/10/technology-change-net-to-scala/) elucidating the motivation, social effect, and final outcome of the company’s decision to choose Scala. It is well worth a read.
