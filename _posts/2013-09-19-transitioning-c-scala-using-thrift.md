A 30 minute presentation on Sept 19th at the [Scala-Toronto Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Scala/Toronto-CA/). The
slides introduce a technical application of [Apache Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org/) and additional features offered by
the [Twitter Finagle](http://twitter.github.io/finagle/).

The overall theme of the meetup was to present lessons learnt using the cross-language RPC capabilities of Thrift to
transition a Microsoft .Net C# workplace to Scala.
