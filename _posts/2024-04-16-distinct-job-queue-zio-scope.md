Job Queues are critical parts of Enterprise workloads. Complex versions use distributed nodes, state machines, and
complex schedulers to trigger and track running jobs. But when simplicity allows, the best approach is to create small
idempotent jobs. The smaller the unit of work, the easier it is to track progress, restart, and minimize wasted time
when failures occur. The ZIO [Resource Management](https://zio.dev/reference/resource/) paradigm allows for a compact
and efficient job queue to be created with minimal amount of code.
