Trade Audit is an Android Mobile App  


Stock market speculation is at a record high. Individuals are following social media accounts trying
to navigate meme-stocks, HODLs, and the opacity of SPACs. There is no accountability, no oversight, and 
 no rules to what can be presented as knowledgeable advice on social media.

Trade Audit is a mobile application that creates accountability.

Use Trade Audit to catalogue any stock advice found on the internet.  Stock trades and ideas can be tracked 
creating an immutable track record that the social media accounts refuse to provide.
